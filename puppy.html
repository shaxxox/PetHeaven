                        <h2>Joy's Details</h2>
                        <p class="details">Joy and his sister Jolie were found all alone in the jungle when they were tiny puppies. Both of them were so small they had to be bottle fed every few hours - but that means they have grown up into very friendly dogs who love hanging out with people.

                            Both Joy and Jolie are friendly, playful and smart dogs. They adore human company. All they want to do is hang out with you and play the day away (maybe even have a little snooze together?!). They have a lovely temperament and are very sweet pups.
                            
                            Joy is a very social personality, and gets along well with humans and with other dogs. He is quite tall and lanky now, but still behaves like a big wiggly puppy when he sees visitors.
                            
                            Joy is extremely food motivated and will respond well to some positive reinforcement training, to teach healthy behaviours.</p>
